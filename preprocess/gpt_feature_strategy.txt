### Task 1: **Identify Important Features for Predicting Exchange Rates**
Here are the critical features from each dataset that are likely to influence exchange rates:

#### **1. EXCHANGE_RATES_SL**
- **DATE**: Essential for time-series alignment (time-dependent behavior).
- **USD, RUB, INR, GBP, EUR, CNY, AUD**: Daily exchange rate values. These are the targets to be predicted (or used for multi-target prediction). If forecasting one currency, the other exchange rates might be important as predictors.

#### **2. SL_ECONOMIC_DATA**
- **SRI_LANKA_GDP_USD_BILLIONS_USD**: GDP captures the overall economic health and impacts currency valuations.
- **MERCHANDISE_IMPORTS_MILLIONS_USD**: Import dependency dynamics can influence currency.
- **MERCHANDISE_EXPORTS_MILLIONS_USD**: Export performance strengthens currency value due to higher inflows.
- **FOREIGN_INVESTMENTS_BILLIONS_USD**: Foreign investments contribute to foreign exchange reserves and currency stability.
- **INFLATION_RATE_PCR**: Inflation affects purchasing power parity, directly impacting exchange rates.
- **ANNUAL_CHANGE_PCR**: Economic changes may influence perception of currency strength.
- **GDP_GROWTH_PCT**: Higher GDP growth tends to correlate positively with currency value.
- **GDP_PER_CAPITA_USD**: Reflects economic prosperity, potentially impacting exchange rates.
- **DATE**: Critical to match datasets temporally. Some features span monthly or yearly, so interpolation may be required.

#### **3. TOURISM_SL**
- **TOURISM_SL**: Tourism-driven foreign currency inflows (e.g., USD, EUR conversion) can influence exchange rates for Sri Lanka, especially for USD, EUR, and GBP.
- **DATE**: To merge and align the features with daily-level datasets.

### Task 2: **Aligning and Merging Tables into a Daily-Level Super Dataset**
To create a unified dataset at a daily granularity, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Normalize Date Formats**
- Ensure each dataset's `DATE` column is in a consistent format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Convert monthly/yearly datasets to daily frequency for exchange rate predictions.

#### **Step 2: Resample ECONOMIC_DATA to Daily Frequency**
- Yearly economic data (e.g., GDP, foreign investments) can be interpolated linearly or with spline interpolation to fill gaps at the daily level.
- For monthly features (like merchandise imports), repeat values for all days within the month or interpolate smoothly.

#### **Step 3: Resample TOURISM_SL Data**
- Monthly tourism data can also be interpolated. Alternatively, repeat monthly values for all days within the corresponding month.

#### **Step 4: Merge All Tables**
- Use an outer join or full join based on the `DATE` feature:
  ```python
  merged_df = exchange_rates_sl.merge(economic_data_daily, on='DATE', how='outer') \
                               .merge(tourism_sl_daily, on='DATE', how='outer')
  ```
- Fill missing data strategically (explained in preprocessing below).

### Task 3: **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Pipeline**
Creating a robust pipeline ensures data consistency and model readiness:

#### **1. Handle Missing Data**
- **Economic Features**: Use forward-fill, backward-fill, or interpolation methods for missing values.
- **Exchange Rates**: For gaps in rates, forward-fill values (assuming continuity between days).
- **Tourism Data**: If interpolating monthly data to daily, use linear or cubic interpolation.

#### **2. Add Temporal Features**
- Derive new time-based columns:
  - **Day of Week** (e.g., Mondayâ€“Sunday): Exchange rates might behave differently on weekends.
  - **Month**: Seasonal trends (e.g., tourism peaks or economic shifts) may affect exchange rates.
  - **Quarter**: Captures broader trends in economy and currency fluctuations.
  
#### **3. Lagged Features (Time-Series Engineering)**
- Create lagged features from exchange rates (e.g., previous day, 7-days ago, etc.):
  - `USD_lag1`, `RUB_lag7`, `GBP_ma30` (3-day, 7-day, and monthly moving averages).
  - Rolling statistics such as trends, volatility (e.g., standard deviation over a window).
  
#### **4. Ratio Features (Economic Ratios)**
- Derived features such as:
  - **Exports-to-Imports Ratio**: Captures trade balance trends.
  - **GDP Growth to Inflation Rate**: Measures currency dynamics relative to domestic economy health.
  - **Tourism Impact**: Tourism value divided by GDP or total exports.

#### **5. Scaling and Normalization**
- Scale numeric features:
  - Z-score normalization (standardization) for stationary time-series data.
  - Min-Max scaling for non-stationary features like exchange rates.

#### **6. One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Data**
- Encode time columns (e.g., month, quarter) as categorical if cyclic patterns exist.

#### **7. Feature Selection**
- Use Pearson correlation and mutual information to remove redundant or non-informative features.

### Task 4: **Suggested Modeling Approaches**

#### **Approach 1: Time-Series Models**
Suitable for sequential dependency in daily data:
1. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**:
   - Effective for single-variable forecasting with seasonal adjustments.
   - Use SARIMA for seasonality corrections if needed.

2. **VAR (Vector Autoregression)**:
   - Multivariate time-series model for influencing currencies (predicting multiple exchange rates simultaneously).

3. **Prophet (Facebook)**:
   - User-friendly library for time-series forecasting.
   - Handles holidays, seasonality, and trend decomposition.

4. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
   - Deep learning-based time-series model for non-linear trends and long-term dependencies.
   - Input lagged features (sliding window of exchange rates) and economic data.

#### **Approach 2: Machine Learning Models**
If non-time-series approaches are preferred, build regression models:
1. **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**:
   - Handles missing data and is ideal for complex feature interactions.
   - Use lagged features and derived ratios as explanatory variables.

2. **Random Forest**:
   - Robust for structured data and reduces risk of overfitting with many features.

#### **Approach 3: Hybrid Modeling**
Combine time-series and ML-based models:
- **Use Time-Series for Predictions**:
  - Predict future trends using SARIMA or LSTM.
- **Machine Learning for Corrections**:
  - Use gradient boosting or ensemble models to predict residual errors.

### Apache Spark or Alternatives

#### **Why Apache Spark?**
- Spark is well-suited for handling large datasets (`EXCHANGE_RATES_SL`, `SL_ECONOMIC_DATA`, etc.).
- Use PySpark for distributed computation on these large tables during merging/interpolation.

#### **Steps with Spark**:
1. **Load Datasets into Spark DataFrames**:
   - `spark.read.format("snowflake").options(...)`
   - Perform joins and transformations efficiently on distributed clusters.

2. **Preprocessing with Spark SQL or PySpark**:
   - Handle nulls and interpolate using Spark SQL functions (`fillna`, `approxQuantile`).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use MLlib for gradient boosting, LSTMs, or time-series models.

#### **Alternatives to Spark**:
- **Pandas/Dask**: If data is manageable locally (up to a few GBs), Pandas/Dask will be faster.
- **MLflow**: Use MLflow with PySpark or Dask for model tracking and pipeline management.
